Notes for TEI 2017 presentation


Clues for analysis/exemplification:

1. Guard dog kept within sight (6) [Telegraph book]: secure
    Ximenean type 6.4: Container and Contents.
    Definition:   Guard
    Construction: dog kept within sight
    Container:    sight = see
    Contents:     dog = cur
    Signal word:  within
    Interesting component: "Guard dog" is the misleading factor, and it 
                            misleads by virtue of being a phrase which 
                            spans the definition and construction. This 
                            is an OVERLAPPING HIERARCHY functioning in 
                            the mind of the solver.
    
2. Four card players wrapping party gifts (6) [Guardian 27,192]: endows
    Ximenean type 6.4: Container and Contents.
    Definition:   gifts
    Construction: Four card players wrapping party
    Container:    four card players = enws
    Contents:     party = do
    Signal word:  wrapping
    Interesting component: Overlapping hierarchy again: "party gifts".
                           Also misleading is the part of speech of 
                           "gifts", noun in the full clue, verb as 
                           the definition.

3. Switch for sale (2, 5) [Araucaria clue posted by a fan:
                           https://www.theguardian.com/discussion/p/3kkpp]: 
                           on offer
    Ximenean type 6.5: Pun; possibly 6.1, One or more meanings.
    Definition:   for sale
    Pun:          switch (an alternative indirect definition)
    Interesting component: The genius here is brevity.

4. Furious about Peruvian ancestry (11) [Araucaria clue posted by a fan:
                           https://www.theguardian.com/discussion/p/3kkpp]: 
                           incandescent
    Ximenean type 6.3: Charade.
    Definition:   furious (metaphoric meaning)
    Construction: Peruvian = Incan, ancestry = descent

5. ! (1, 6, 1, 4) [Araucaria clue posted by a fan:
                           https://www.theguardian.com/discussion/p/3kkpp]: 
                           I haven't a clue
    Ximenean type 7.8: Unclassified
    Interesting component: Arguably this is a pun, but it's sort of a meta-clue
                           which acknowledges it's in the realm of the crossword.

Points for presentation:

USE: 

Mixomatosis (Larkin):

Caught in the centre of a soundless field
While hot inexplicable hours go by
What trap is this? Where were its teeth concealed?
You seem to ask.

                 I make a sharp reply,
Then clean my stick. I’m glad I can’t explain
Just in what jaws you were to supperate:
You may have thought things would come right again
If you could only keep quite still and wait.

Focus on "I make a sharp reply / Then clean my stick." On first reading,
the reader stumbles over this divided line -- what is the reply, what is
the stick? The stick is of course a gun, and the reply a euthanistic shot;
the purpose of the puzzlement is perhaps to give us a half-blind rabbit's
uncomprehending view of the event. The real meaning of the reply metaphor
is obscured partly by the coherence of the phrase "sharp reply". The 
reader, in unmasking the metaphor, experiences a moment of pleasurable
realization or recognition which is very similar to the sensation we 
experience as crossword solvers, untangling a clever clue.
