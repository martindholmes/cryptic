Notes for TEI 2017 presentation

Ximenean types:

1. 

Clues for analysis/exemplification:

1. Guard dog kept within sight (6) [Telegraph book]
    Ximenean type 4: Container and Contents.
    Definition:   Guard
    Construction: dog kept within sight
    Container:    sight = see
    Contents:     dog = cur
    Signal word:  within
    Interesting component: "Guard dog" is the misleading factor, and it 
                            misleads by virtue of being a phrase which 
                            spans the definition and construction. This 
                            is an OVERLAPPING HIERARCHY functioning in 
                            the mind of the solver.
